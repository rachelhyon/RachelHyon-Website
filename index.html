        <p class="lead mb-4">I have volunteered at soup kitchens and elderly homes in the past. Becuase of that, I am very patient, diligent, and hardworking when it comes to getting things done. I was in charge of cleaning the rooms of the elderly or making sure that those who stayed at the homes were doing okay. I was also involved in a club named Interact, which was a service club that raised funds for certain causes. The most recent cause that I served was to help build homes for people in the more poorer parts of Spain. I was a contributor to thousands of dollars that were sent to a main organization that helped build homes because I served in the fundraising. I helped plan fundraisers, build plans for profit, and attend events that helped rally support for the club. Additionally, over the past few years, I have also developed lots of charisma from leading events at my church. I am experienced in event planning, out-of-the-box creative thinking, and delegating. Since I had a team of other youth members who were willing to serve at church, I was the one who delegated all of the tasks so that the night ran smoothly.<br><br>

        I currently work at a chicken restaurant called Vons Chicken. It is located in Fremont, CA and I work as a chicken chef. Most of the workload includes heavy lifting, multitasking, and focusing on certain tasks for a long period of time. The kitchen is very small, so the other chefs and I have created a synergy that allows us to move swiftly without a flaw. The dinner rush forces us to work quickly, so I am very good with my hands. I am also a very good team player, but I am not afraid to take charge when needed.<br><br>

        Whenever a technical issue occured at Vons Chicken with one of the delivery services that we parter with, I am the one who is contacted. On the team of employees, I hold the most experience with dealing with impatient delivery drivers or orders that were messed up online. I am very technologically savvy and h ave lots of experience in editing menus or schedules online. If there is an angry customer on the phone because we got their order wrong or we missed an item in the bag, I am put on the phone so that I can negotiate a deal with them for the next time they return. I have a very close and personal relationship with the owner, so he trusts that I can handle giving discounts when I need to. I am given lots of responsibility at work and I take them all very seriously.
